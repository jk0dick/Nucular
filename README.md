# Nucular

##The Basics
- One nuclear reactor heats enough water for 20 steam engines ore 2 steam turbines (space-saving version of the steam engine)
- Enriched uranium is used as fuel, the spent fuel can be reprocessed
- With enough technologies researched you can start converting your depleted uranium stores into plutonium in breeder reactors
- The plutonium can be used as nuclear fuel, increasing the fuel value of uranium tenfold
- If you don't want to fight spawners, you can now use plutonium to create alien science packs. On the other hand, uranium turned out to be pretty usefull against aliens 

##Weapons
- You can use depleted uranium to produce armour-piercing ammunition
- Highly enriched uranium or plutonium is used for an atomic bomb
- Nuclear explosion increases the biter evolution factor, so using them in masse might be a bad idea
- The evolution factor will increase by 0.2%, the same amount as destroying an enemy spawner

##Basic chain
2x Electrical drill (Uranium ore) →  1x Chemical plant (Uranium) → 2x Assembling machine 3 (Enriched Uranium) → 0.1x Assembling machine 3 (Nuclear Fuel) → 1x Nuclear plant → 2x Steam Turbine / 20x Steam engine

One nuclear plant produces 10 steam each second, enough for 2 steam turbines. Nuclear fuel lasts for 100 seconds in a power plant under full load.

##Breeder chain
- 1x Nuclear reactor (plutonium production)
- 1x Nuclear reactor (energy production)
- 0.2x Assembling machine 3 (recycling)
- 0.1x Assembling machine 3 (MOX fuel production)
- 2x Steam turbine

Nuclear fuel lasts for 400 seconds in the breeder reactor and turns 20 depleted uranium into 20 plutonium.
In the same time the reactor consumes four fuel assemblies.
The five spent assemblies can be recycled (5 plutonium, 40 uranium) and turned into five new MOX fuel assemblies (25 plutonium, 40 uranium, 25 steel plates).
